I have an assignment on Deep learning and Neural Networks.
I need to make a neural network, using pytorch and any other needed libraries.
I have the 2070 GPU and want to use it to speed up the process.
The data set is cifar-10 which I have already downloaded, although you can ignore this if it works better.
I have made a version of the intermediate part of the assignment.

Include: 
1. simple MLP
2. complex MLP
3. simple CNN
4. complex CNN
5. transfer learning
6. A script for plotting results and testing
7. Optional data manipulation to add more data
8. A report on why each architecture is used what we expected to see in general terms

I want one or more models for each technique as necesery.
Include experiments with different activation functions, parameters, optimizers in your scripts.
Keep everything in separate files.
This assignment is meant to be an exploration of deep learning applications.
There must be a reasoning for every architecture used and a clear process from simpler to more complex solutions.
Explain each architecture, both theory and the python script.
Assume I know very little about python and Neural Networks.
